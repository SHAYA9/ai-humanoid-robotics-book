  "description": "Welcome to the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the communication backbone of modern robotics. While not a traditional operating system like Windows or Linux, ROS 2 provides a powerful framework of libraries and tools to help you build complex robot applications. Think of it less as an OS and more as a robotic nervous system—a standardized way for different parts of your robot to communicate and work together.",
