  "description": "As your robotics application grows from two nodes to ten, twenty, or even a hundred, starting and configuring each one manually becomes impossible. This is where ROS 2's launch system comes in. Launch files are powerful scripts that allow you to start, configure, and connect a complex system of nodes with a single command.",
