  "description": "One of the most powerful features of Gazebo is its ability to simulate a wide range of robotic sensors. The data generated by these virtual sensors is published to ROS 2 topics, just like data from real hardware. This allows you to test your entire perception and control stack in the simulation without needing a physical robot.",
