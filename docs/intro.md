# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence

**Bridging the gap between digital brain and physical body.**

This course is a deep dive into the exciting world of **Physical AI**, where the boundaries between digital intelligence and physical embodiment blur. We will explore how to build and program intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the real world, with a focus on **humanoid robotics**.

This is not just a theoretical course. You will get hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies, including:

-   **ROS 2:** The open-source standard for robotics middleware.
-   **Gazebo & Unity:** Powerful physics simulators for creating and testing digital twins.
-   **NVIDIA Isaac™:** A state-of-the-art platform for AI-powered robotics.
-   **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models:** The next generation of AI that combines vision, language, and action.

By the end of this course, you will have the skills to design, build, and program your own autonomous humanoid robots, capable of performing complex tasks in dynamic environments.

## Who is This For?

This course is designed for university students, robotics engineers, and AI researchers who are passionate about the future of embodied intelligence. It is an advanced undergraduate to graduate-level course, and a strong foundation in programming and mathematics is recommended.

Let's begin the journey into the future of robotics.
