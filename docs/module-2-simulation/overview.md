# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2. In this section, we will explore the concept of the **digital twin** and learn how to use powerful simulation tools like **Gazebo** and **Unity** to create realistic virtual environments for our robots.

## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or system. In robotics, a digital twin is a simulation of a robot and its environment that is so accurate that it can be used to develop and test the robot's software before deploying it on the physical hardware.

This is a crucial concept in modern robotics, as it allows us to:

-   **Develop and test in parallel:** We can start writing the robot's software before the physical hardware is ready.
-   **Reduce the risk of damage:** We can test new algorithms in simulation without the risk of damaging the physical robot.
-   **Accelerate development:** We can run simulations faster than real-time and in parallel, which allows us to test a wide range of scenarios in a short amount of time.

## Key Topics

In this module, we will cover the following topics:

-   **Gazebo Physics:** The open-source standard for robotics simulation. We will learn how to use Gazebo to create realistic physics-based simulations of our robots and their environments.
-   **Unity Rendering:** A powerful game engine that can be used to create stunning, high-fidelity visualizations of our simulations.
-   **Sensor Simulation:** How to simulate a variety of sensors, including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs.
-   **Environment Building:** The process of creating complex, realistic environments for our robots to interact with.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

-   Understand the concept of a digital twin and its importance in robotics.
-   Create a Gazebo simulation of a humanoid robot.
-   Integrate Gazebo with Unity for high-fidelity rendering.
-   Simulate a variety of sensors.
-   Build a custom environment for your robot.
