# Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac

Welcome to Module 3! In this section, we'll dive into the **NVIDIA Isaac** ecosystem, a powerful platform for developing and deploying AI-powered robots. Isaac provides a suite of tools that accelerate the entire robotics workflow, from simulation to deployment.

## Key Components

*   **Isaac Sim:** A photorealistic, physically-accurate robotics simulator built on NVIDIA's Omniverse platform. It's designed for developing, testing, and training AI-based robots in a virtual environment.
*   **Isaac ROS:** A collection of hardware-accelerated packages for ROS 2 that leverage NVIDIA's GPU technology to improve the performance of perception, navigation, and manipulation tasks.
*   **Isaac Manipulator:** A workflow for developing and optimizing robotic manipulation solutions, with pre-trained models and tools for motion generation.
*   **Isaac Perceptor:** A reference design for building autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) with advanced 3D perception capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   Understand the key components of the NVIDIA Isaac platform.
*   Set up and run a robotics simulation in Isaac Sim.
*   Integrate Isaac ROS packages into a ROS 2 application.
*   Develop a basic understanding of how to use Isaac for perception and navigation tasks.
*   Appreciate the benefits of GPU acceleration in robotics.
