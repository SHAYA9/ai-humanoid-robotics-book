# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4! This is where we bring everything together to explore the exciting frontier of **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models in robotics. VLAs are AI models that can understand and respond to natural language commands, perceive the world through vision, and take actions to accomplish tasks.

## The VLA Paradigm

The core idea behind VLAs is to create a single, end-to-end model that can map from multi-modal inputs (e.g., camera images, voice commands) to robot actions (e.g., motor commands). This is a departure from traditional robotics, where perception, planning, and control are often treated as separate, hand-engineered modules.

## Key Components

*   **Vision Encoder:** Processes the raw visual input from cameras and extracts meaningful features.
*   **Language Encoder:** Processes the natural language command and encodes its meaning.
*   **Action Decoder:** Takes the combined vision and language features and generates a sequence of actions for the robot to execute.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   Understand the basic architecture of a Vision-Language-Action model.
*   Appreciate the role of large language models (LLMs) in robotics.
*   Learn how to integrate voice commands using a speech-to-text system like Whisper.
*   Explore how to combine multi-modal inputs for robot control.
*   Build a simple VLA-based capstone project.
